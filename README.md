Observations from WeatherPy:
1. As expected, the weather becomes significantly warmer as one approaches the equator (0 Deg. Latitude).
2.The chart for humidity shows a surprisingly weak correlation between humidity and latitude. Most humidity levels tend to fall between 60-100%. This is slightly unexpected given that weather and temperature fluxes based on its latitude.
3. The chart for cloudiness shows a very interesting pattern across latitudes. This is a weak correlation between cloudiness and latitude. However, the cloudiness is interesting in that it is set more frequency at the same level as other places, much less scattered than the other visualizations.
